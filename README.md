Personal repo for learning how to build a SpringMVC project.

At the moment (2014-05-02) there are files in this repo that are usually ignored. I did this because I am looking to solve a problem and thus would like to show the whole project to outsiders. It represents the project after executing maven goal `package`

Thank you for your help ;-)
